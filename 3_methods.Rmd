# Methods 

## Construction of a tariff structure for a MTPL insurance product
Our goal is to build a tariff structure for a portfolio of Motor Third Party liabilities based on a set of policy holder risk that were presented and described in the first chapter. The main modeling strategy we follow in this paper is motivated by (citation of Katrin’s paper on GAMs). The authors state that because insurance is a highly regulated business there is a need to use transparent pricing modeling techniques that are easily explainable to any kind of stakeholder. This is especially tricky to incorporate when
  
$\pi_i = E[F_i] \times E[S_i]$
  
Where $E[F_i]$ is the expected claim frequency and $E[S_i]$ is the expected claim severity. Because we assume independence we can multiply these two components and get the expected total claim amount per policy holder denoted by pi_i. This quantity we call in Non-Life Insurance the Pure Premium. On top of that we add a Risk Loading so we make sure every client is charged with a Risk Premium that also covers a claim amount which might exceed our expectations. We discuss the Risk Premium calculation in the third chapter. To fully commercialize the premium insurance companies add costs related to the insurance policy and a profit margin on top of the Risk Premium, but we won’t touch upon this.
